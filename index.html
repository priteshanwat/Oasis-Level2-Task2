            same unit as his father.

            deployed against the Chinese People's Liberation Army.The standoff was the first military
            confrontation along the disputed McMahon Line after the 1962 war.
            <br><br>
            He had much experience in high-altitude warfare and spent ten years conducting counter-insurgency
            operations.He commanded a company in Uri, Jammu and Kashmir as a Major. As a Colonel, he commanded

            Sopore.

            Rawat commanded MONUSCO (a Multinational Brigade in a Chapter VII mission in the Democratic Republic of
            the Congo). Within two weeks of deployment in the DRC, the Brigade faced a major offensive in the east
            which threatened the regional capital of North Kivu, Goma. The offensive also threatened to destabilise
            the country as a whole. The situation demanded a rapid response and North Kivu Brigade was reinforced,
            where it was responsible for over 7,000 men and women, representing nearly half of the total MONUSCO
            force. Whilst simultaneously engaged in offensive kinetic operations against the CNDP and other armed
            groups, Rawat (then Brigadier) carried out tactical support to the Congolese Army (FARDC), He sensitised
            programmes with the local population and detailed coordination to ensure that all were informed about
            the situation and worked together in the progress of operations. He was responsible for the protection
            of the vulnerable population.
            <br><br>
            This operational period lasted for four months. Goma never fell, the East stabilized and the main armed
            group was motivated to the negotiating table and has since been integrated into the FARDC. He was also
            tasked to present the Revised Charter of Peace Enforcement to the Special Representatives of the
            Secretary-General and Force Commanders of all the UN missions in a special conference at Wilton Park,
            London, on 16 May 2009.Rawat was twice awarded the Force Commander’s Commendation.
            <br><br>

            Division (Uri). As a Lieutenant General, he commanded III Corps, headquartered in Dimapur, before taking
            over the Southern Command in Pune.
